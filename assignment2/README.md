# CP1404 Assignment 2 - Movies to Watch 2.0 by YOUR_NAME

A Python project with GUI and Console programs that (re)use classes to manage a list of *Movies to Watch*.


# Project Reflection

## 1. How long did the entire project (assignment 2) take you?
Almost one week.
Note: You may like to use the WakaTime plugin, which tracks exactly how long you spend in code. 
See http://wakatime.com (but note that the free version only has a 7-day history)

## 2. What are you most satisfied with?
The most satisfied place is to be able to make the program roughly, now want to be more proficient than before.
## 3. What are you least satisfied with?
The most unsatisfying part is that there are still some unclear places need the help of friends, not to notice some small details.The overall thought is unclear.
## 4. What worked well in your development process?
movie.py,test_movie.py,moviecollection.py and test_moviecollection.py runniing well.
## 5. What about your process could be improved the next time you do a project like this?
Write down the general sequence first, gather your thoughts, and get the program organized.Do it more autonomously, without asking others.
## 6. Describe what learning resources you used and how you used them.
I used the contents of my weekly exercises and looked up relevant materials from the Internet.If you look at the weekly exercises, you can see what's close to this assignment and then program it.I can better understand the function of the code by checking the related information online.
## 7. Describe the main challenges or obstacles you faced and how you overcame them.
The main challenge I faced was that each small program could be written on its own, but with a large program it was confusing and I didn't know where to start.Figure out where the whole process of the program starts before you do it, and then work your way through it bit by bit.
## 8. Briefly describe your experience using classes and if/how they improved your code.
A class is a collection of data, an abstract collection of operation descriptions.You can just use the class as a container, or you can make the entire program cleaner and easier to check.
